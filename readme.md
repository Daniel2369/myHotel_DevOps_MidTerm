# 🏨 Hotel Room Management System
Welcome to the Hotel Room Management System ! This project is a Python-based application designed to manage hotel rooms, track occupancy, and provide room details. It also includes a web interface and containerization using Docker for easy deployment.

# Web Application

# 🏨 Hotel Room Management System

A simple hotel room management system built with **FastAPI** and **Jinja2** templates, 
Designed to demonstrate:
* FastAPI operations
* room assignments 
* guest check-in/check-out functionalities
All in a clean HTML UI.

---
## 🌟 Project Overview

This system allows hotel staff to:

- 📥 Add new rooms  
- 🧹 Delete rooms  
- 📝 Update room information  
- ✅ Check guests into available rooms  
- ❌ Check guests out of rooms  
- 📊 View all rooms in a color-coded table (vacant or occupied)

Everything is handled through clean, interactive web forms and served via FastAPI.

---

## ✨ Features

### 🔧 Core Functionality

- **Create Room**: Add new rooms with category, cost, and optional guest name.
- **Delete Room**: Remove rooms from the system by room ID.
- **Update Room**: Modify any room's details including cost, guest name, or category.
- **Check-In**: Assign a guest to the first available room of the selected category.
- **Check-Out**: Free up a room and mark it as available again.
- **Room Dashboard**: View a table of all rooms with live status (occupied/vacant), color-coded.

### 💻 Web Interface
- Built using **FastAPI** with **Jinja2 HTML templates**
- CSS styling for forms and tables
- Feedback messages appear after each form action (success/failure)

## 🐳 Running with Docker

### 1. Build the Docker image
- Easily containerized using Docker for consistent deployment
- Run anywhere with one command
  
```bash
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 -t hotels:latest . (For MacOS)
docker run -d --name hotels-container -p 8000:8000 hotels:latest
# Inside the host machine run ip a and take the IPv4
# Browse to http://<IPv4>:8000
```

# AWS Deployment
## 🚀 Deploy Docker Web App from ECR to Elastic Beanstalk with:
* Private Subnets,
* NAT Gateway
* Load Balancer

This guide explains how to deploy a Docker-based web application stored in **Amazon ECR** to **Elastic Beanstalk**, using a secure and scalable infrastructure:

- EC2 instances in **private subnets**
- Access to **Amazon ECR**
- NAT Gateway for outbound traffic
- Application Load Balancer for inbound HTTP traffic
- Auto Scaling across 2 Availability Zones

---

## 🧱 Prerequisites

Before starting:

- ✅ AWS account
- ✅ Docker image pushed to [Amazon ECR](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/docker-push-ecr-image.html)
- ✅ AWS CLI installed
- ✅ IAM permissions to manage VPC, EC2, ECR, Elastic Beanstalk, and IAM roles

---

## 📦 Step 1: Prepare `Dockerrun.aws.json`

Create a file named `Dockerrun.aws.json` in the root of your project and zip it:

```json
{
  "AWSEBDockerrunVersion": "1",
  "Image": {
    "Name": "123456789012.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my-service:latest", # ECR Repo/image
    "Update": "true"
  },
  "Ports": [
    {
      "ContainerPort": 8000
    }
  ]
}
```
Zip the the json file.

## 🌐 Step 2: Create a Secure VPC Architecture
In the AWS Console, go to the VPC Dashboard and create:

### ✅ 1. VPC
CIDR block: 10.0.0.0/16

Enable DNS hostnames & DNS resolution

### ✅ 2. Subnets
2 Public Subnets (e.g., 10.0.1.0/24 in us-east-1a, 10.0.2.0/24 in us-east-1b)

2 Private Subnets (e.g., 10.0.11.0/24, 10.0.12.0/24)

Tag accordingly (e.g., Name: PublicSubnetA, PrivateSubnetB)

### ✅ 3. Internet Gateway
Attach to the VPC

Update public subnet route table to route 0.0.0.0/0 → IGW

### ✅ 4. NAT Gateway
Allocate Elastic IP

Create NAT Gateway in one public subnet using that Elastic IP

Update private subnet route table to route 0.0.0.0/0 → NAT Gateway

### ✅ 5. Create Security Groups
| Rule Type     | Protocol | Port | Source      | Purpose                      |
| ------------- | -------- | ---- | ----------- | ---------------------------- |
| Inbound Rule  | HTTP     | 80   | `0.0.0.0/0` | Allow public web traffic     |
| Outbound Rule | All      | All  | `0.0.0.0/0` | Allow ALB to forward traffic |

🔧 Attach this SG to the Application Load Balancer.

✅ 2. EC2 Instance Security Group (SG-EC2)
| Rule Type     | Protocol | Port | Source      | Purpose                     |
| ------------- | -------- | ---- | ----------- | --------------------------- |
| Inbound Rule  | TCP      | 8000 | SG-ALB      | Allow traffic from ALB only |
| Outbound Rule | All      | All  | `0.0.0.0/0` | Allow app to access ECR/etc |

🔧 Attach this SG to the Elastic Beanstalk EC2 instances.

Make sure the inbound rule uses the SG ID of the ALB, not 0.0.0.0/0, for internal-only access.

### ✅ 6. Configure Route Tables
Public Subnet Route Table
Associated with: Public Subnets
Contains:
Destination      Target
0.0.0.0/0        Internet Gateway (igw-xxxxxx)

Used by: ALB and NAT Gateway

Private Subnet Route Table
Associated with: Private Subnets
Contains:
Destination      Target
0.0.0.0/0        NAT Gateway (nat-xxxxxx)
Used by: EC2 instances (Elastic Beanstalk app servers)

## 🔐 Step 3: Set Up IAM Role for EC2
Go to IAM > Roles

Locate the EC2 instance profile used by Elastic Beanstalk (e.g., aws-elasticbeanstalk-ec2-role)

Attach the policy: AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryReadOnly

This allows EC2 to pull your image from ECR.

## 🏗 Step 4: Deploy to Elastic Beanstalk
Go to Elastic Beanstalk Console
